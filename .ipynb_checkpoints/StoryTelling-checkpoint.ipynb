    "Over the years, Spotify has provided countless hours of music to choose from for customers of all types. We will explore the [Spotify Dataset 1921-2021, 160k+](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks) consisting of over 160,000 songs from a century of music. Within the data set, we have audio info for each song (tempo, loudness, etc), popularity, artist info, as well as release date/year, among other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we would like to know are the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How does popularity compare over time and among all songs within Spotify?\n",
    "* Are there any relationships between the audio measures?\n",
    "* Do explicit songs tend to be less positive?\n",
    "* Does music follow economic trends in regards to happiness?"
